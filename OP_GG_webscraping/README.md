**Project was created to web scrape op.gg with BeautifulSoup and Selenium**

**Selenium was used to display each match history detail, while Beautifulsoup scraped all the details**

**As project runs on Selenium and Chrome driver, a different driver.exe file may be required depending on what version of Chrome is being used.**

Return match details such as:
- Match Name
- Match Result
- Summoner Names
- Control Wards
- Wards Placed
- Wards Killed
- Damage
- CS
